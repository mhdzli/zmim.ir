`` " Jump back to the last position jumped from "

`. " Jump to position where last change occurred in current buffer "

`[ and `] " Jump to beginning/end of last changed or yanked text "

`< and `> " Jump to beginning/end of last visual selection "

:jump " Show the jump list (places you’ve jumped to with motion commands, specifically those listed at :h jump-motions) "
