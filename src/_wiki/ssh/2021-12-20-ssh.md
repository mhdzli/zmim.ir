# Get and Configure Your Git and GitHub SSH Keys

{% highlight bash %}
# Check for an existing SSH key
ls -al ~/.ssh
# If you don't see any output or that directory doesn't exist (you get a No such file or directory message), then run:
mkdir $HOME/.ssh
# Then generate a new set of keys with
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C your@email.com
# Add your SSH key to ssh-agent
# First, make sure that ssh-agent is running with:
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" # for Mac and Linux
# or:
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-agent -s # for Windows
# Then, add your private key to ssh-agent with:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# Copy your public SSH key
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub # Linux
# Or for Windows, simply run:
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub # Windows
# Add your public SSH key to GitHub
# Go to your GitHub settings page and click the "New SSH key" button:
# Then give your key a recognizable title and paste in your public (id_rsa.pub) key
# Finally, test your authentication with:
ssh -T git@github.com
# If you've followed all of these steps correctly, you should see this message:
# Hi your_user_name! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell
# Add custom ssh-key
git config --local core.sshCommand "/usr/bin/ssh -i /home/me/.ssh/id_rsa_foo"

# Adding terminfo entries to a remote machine

{% highlight bash %}
# If you already have the terminfo description for the emulator you are using
rsync /path/to/emu.terminfo remote-machine:/tmp
ssh remote-machine
sudo tic /tmp/emu.terminfo

# Automagically generate the terminfo for your current emulator and pipe it over ssh
infocmp | ssh remote-machine "tic -x /dev/stdin"

# If the remote machine is very old and/or an odd minimal system, it may not have `/dev/stdin` and `tic` may not be able to open `/dev/stdin`
infocmp | ssh remote-machine "cat > /tmp/terminfo && tic -x /tmp/terminfo; rm /tmp/terminfo"
{% endhighlight %}

# Connect to a running swaywm on remote

{% highlight bash %}
ssh <REMOTE_SYSTEM>
export SWAYSOCK=/run/user/${UID=$(id -u)}/sway-ipc.$UID.$(pgrep -x sway).SWAYSOCK
swaymsg exec <GUI_APP> # Run any gui app like `foot wayvnc 0.0.0.0` for vnc connection on sway
{% endhighlight %}
